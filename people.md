  <br>Welcome to the website. I'm Sean. I'm an evolutionary biologist and ecologist fascinated by many topics within these fields, but probably none more so than the fantastic diversity of life, how it evolves, and how it is maintained. My favourite approach to science is to ask big questions and develop novel quantitative approaches to address them. All the better if those questions have been topics of some debate. Much of my work is done on computers, but I've also conducted extensive field work on four continents and collect data in forests, mountains, and near the ocean as much as possible. When I'm not in those beautiful places, I enjoy great restaurants, movies, my dogs, and my friends.

   <br> I am an evolutionary biologist by training who enjoys working on exciting questions, and learning about new tools and technologies while doing so. After completing my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune in India, I joined Prof. Marko Mutanen's research group at University of Oulu (Finland) for my PhD. My doctoral research focused on resolving taxonomic challenges in different groups of butterflies and moths using genomic approaches (mainly target enrichment). For my postdoctoral research, I am now shifting my focus to broader questions in evolutionary genomics, including speciation, adaptation, and molecular evolution. I am specifically interested in understanding molecular evolutionary processes that drive divergence in closely related speciating taxa and how it progresses across the continuum of differentiation (i.e., the "speciation continuum"). 
 <br> In my free time, I like to read novels, practice chess, try my hands at different forms of art and craft, and seize every opportunity to travel and hike.

  <br><b>xzhang3237@gatech.edu</b>
   <br> My name is Martin, and I graduated from the UC Davis with a B.S. in Genetics and Genomics. My research interests focus on using genomic approaches to investigate speciation, evolutionary processes, and ecological adaptation. I am particularly interested in how genetic variation interacts with environmental factors to shape biodiversity and evolutionary trajectories. Currently, my project explores the dynamical nature of "islands" of genomic divergence and how they change upon secondary contact as a model for understanding the dynamics of speciation.

  <b>Robert Ernst</b> Undergraduate Researcher <img src="/assets/robert_ernst.jpg" alt="Bobby" style="width:150px;height:225px;">
  <br><b>rernst6@gatech.edu</b>
   <br> Robert Ernst is an evolutionary ecologist broadly interested how mountain species are adapting to various climatic and behavioral pressures. He is currently working with the Anderson lab to develop and synthesize a large database of hybrid fitness across plants and animals (i.e. The Hybrid Fitness Consortium). Robert is also working with <a href="https://benjamingfreeman.com/"><i>Dr. Benjamin Freeman's </i></a> Mountain bird lab on an analysis of large citizen science databases to demonstrate how cowbird nest parasitism strategies change over their range.
