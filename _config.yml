title: "Sean A. S. Anderson"
subtitle: "I am an evolutionary biologist studying the processes that generate species-level biodiversity. My research focuses on speciation and the evolution of coexistence between close relatives, and a key aim of my work is to draw statistical generalizations about the hypothesized drivers of these two processes. To this end, I develop and deploy new analytical tools to ask questions like "is ecology-based divergent selection generally required for speciation?" and "do the processes promoting coexstence tend do differ among environments?". I am particularly interested in diversification dynamics in non-model systems -- lineages that evolve and speciate in the complex continental settings home to most of life. 

Currently I am a PhD candidate in Jason Weir's lab (website) at the University of Toronto. I'm entering the final year of my thesis work, so if you're a PI and would like to discuss potential postdoc partnerships in 2022, please reach out. "
