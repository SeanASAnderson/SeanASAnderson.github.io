I love reading popular science. I also enjoy the considerable challenge of trying to clearly explain scientific issues in interesting ways in writing. But in the second year of my PhD, I found that there were few outlets to which unknown junior researchers could submit this kind of work.

To help fill the void, in 2018 I created the [EEB Quarterly](https://theeebquarterly.github.io), a full-length magazine run by grad students for grad students in the EEB department at the University of Toronto. The magazine's mission is to celebrate the personalities and achievements of those in the EEB community and to provide a rejection-free space for students to practice writing about science in jargon-light prose for a general audience.

I served as Editor in Chief for the first five issues. Leading an editorial board of 12 volunteers, I determined the focus and aims of each release, solicited contributions, provided guidance with stories, curated photos, designed layouts, and typeset the issues on free (but clunky and maddening) software (that I hate).

During this time, I wrote the editorials and contributed two feature essays: a tutorial for running R scripts on UofTâ€™s Niagara supercomputer, and an interview with Professor Sharon Strauss (the 2019 Atwood Colloquium's keynote speaker). I also designed a photo essay from stunning images of the Canadian arctic captured by fellow grad students Clara Thaysen and Russel Turner. I stepped down as EIC in 2020 and continue to serve as a newsletter editor. 

Please visit the EEB Quarterly's website to download our published issues. Be sure to set your PDF reader to 2-page view format -- the Quarterly is formatted as a magazine and contains spreads that don't make sense when viewed one page at a time.
