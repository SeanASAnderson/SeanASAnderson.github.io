**FOR SPECIES RICHNESS TO EVOLVE IN A CLADE, two processes must occur**. First, lineages must split into two or more descendants (i.e. they must speciate), and second, descendant lineages must establish overlapping ranges. 

While the first requirement is self-evident, the second follows from the fact that speciation is largely an allopatric process, and allopatry is often achieved when a species’ range is split into two or more isolated subdivisions (i.e. “vicariance”). **But vicariance alone is ultimately limited in its ability to generate diversity**, as ranges can only be split so many times and still support viable populations. For diversification to continue, lineages must expand geographically to attain range sizes that can bear further subdivision. In nature, this means lineages must often overlap with close relatives. 

Speciation and the establishment of sympatry are thus two critical rate-limiting steps in the diversification cycle. The primary focus of my research is to better understand their drivers.

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> ## Key Research Questions </h2>

#### 1. The role of ecological divergence in speciation and the establishment of sympatry

For the past twenty years, evolutionary ecologists have largely viewed diversification through the lens of the Ecological Theory of Adaptive Radiation (ETAR; Schluter 2000), an intuitive and influential synthesis in which both speciation and the establishment of sympatry are driven by divergent natural selection. In the theory's classic formulation, reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of behavioural, phenotypic, or intrinsic genetic changes that accumulate when allopatric lineages adapt in different directions along niche axes such as habitat or diet (“ecological speciation”). Later, when lineages begin to overlap geographically, competition for resources leads to renewed divergent selection and greater ecological divergence (“ecological character displacement”).

Evidence for the ETAR's main tenets has been reported in a number of detailed studies, leading many authors to suggest that adaptive radiation is a generally important mechanism in diversification1,12. However, many of these studies have focused on systems from insular island-like habitats5-7,13. Newly discovered patterns of genetic and phenotypic divergence in continental taxa, meanwhile, contradict some expectations of this framework14-21. For instance, genomic evidence from tropical avian contact zones show that reproductive isolation readily evolves to virtual completion between lineages with marked ecological similarity. And a growing number of macroevolutionary analyses conclude that clade-wide diversification is more limited by geographic than ecological opportunity. 

An outstanding question is whether ecological divergence is generally required for speciation or coexistence in the more complex ecological theatres in which diversity most generally evolves.

##### Approaches

Addressing the generality of ecological divergence as an engine of diversification requires a comparative statistical approach. While fine-grained ecological details can't feasibly be obtained for very large numbers of lineages, ecological *differences* between closely related species can be inferred from differences in ecomorphology. Such ecological trait measurements are much more readiliy obtainable from field and museum specimens. I thus work with and formulate statistical models and simulation-based models of trait divergence between closely related lineage pairs. 

**Model processes**: Trait differences between lineages can arise for a variety of reasons, and indeed differences in trait means are inevitable given enough time. A key aim of my work has been to determine the statistical signature of trait divergence resulting from divergent selection versus alternative processes like drift, parallel selection, and fluctuating selection (Anderson and Weir, 2020).

**Addressing Speciaton**: mixture models (Anderson et al. *Under Review*)

**Addressing Sympatry**  models to distinguish between character displacement and species sorting (Anderson and Weir 2021)

**Model Scales**: Models of ecomorphological evolution are often concerned with changes in traits across the branches of a phylogenetic tree over relatively deep timescales. But the processes promoting speciation and coexistence are easily obscured by the passage of time. 
The trait divergence models I work with are targeted for timescales relevant to most speciation events, which typically require hundreds to single-digit thousands of millenia (exceptional examples of rapid (and often-ephemeral) speciation on islands notwithstanding).

### Geographic variation in the processes promoting speciation and coexistence

Geographic variation in species richness implies geographic variation in speciation (and the subsequent establishment of sympatry), colonization, and/or extinction. I'm interested in whether and how the mechanism of speciation and the dynamics of secondary sympatry vary across environments. Ultimately I am interested in how the answer to these questions help explain broadscale diversity patterns. 

### Reinforcement and the role of sexual interference in preventing the establishment of sympatry

Ecological competition has long been considered an important factor determining when and if species coexist, but interactions related to sex may also have important and overlooked consequences for range overlap. Such 'sexual interference' includes the production of maladapted hybrids as well as less-well-understood interactions like (factoften-overloooked factor is that of sexual interference between closely related lineages. 'Sexual interference' refers to costly interactions related to sex (rather than ecological resource use).

I thus primarily work with sets of recently diverged lineage pairs rather than larger clades, and I  focus on divergence between recently diverged lineage pairs rather than larger cladeswork with and formulate models of trait divergence between closely related lineage pairs. These include sister species and 'phylogroup' splits within currently recognized taxonomic species. Such models cover timescales relevant to most speciation events, which typically require hundreds to single-digit thousands of millenia (exceptional examples of rapid (and often-ephemeral) speciation on islands notwithstanding).

Model processes: divergent adaptation. Sister species (or deeply diverged 'phylogroups' within currently recognized taxonomic species). 



(and in fact drive) a focus on trait divergence between closely related (and thus recently diverged) lineages means 'contemporary macroevolution'. 





#### Speciation
Some authors (e.g. Cutter and Grey 2016) have proposed that ecological speciation is commoner in high latitude regions than it is in the tropics. Others have instead suggested that 





I'm interested in how the mechanism of speciation and the establishment of sympatry can help account for several broadscale diversity patterns, including the latitudinal diversity gradient. 



, and how this helps explain broadscale diversity patterns like the latiduinal diversity gradient.




 While extinction is almost certainly a significant driver of large-scale diversity patterns such as the latitudinal gradient, it's probable that variation in the tempo and mode of speciation and the establishment of sympatry also play a role.

For much of the recent past, evolutionary ecologists working on speciation and coexistence have relied on naturally occurring model systems -- recently diverged lineages evolving in simplified ecological settings such as young habitat islands. While these systems are tractable, their environmental circustances are exceptional. This makes generalizataion difficult. My work often centres around lineages evolving in the more complex continental settings home to most of life.
