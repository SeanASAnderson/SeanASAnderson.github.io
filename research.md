**FOR SPECIES RICHNESS TO EVOLVE IN A CLADE, two processes must occur**. First, lineages must split into two or more descendants (i.e. they must speciate), and second, descendant lineages must establish overlapping ranges. 

While the first requirement is self-evident, the second follows from the fact that speciation is largely an allopatric process, and allopatry is often achieved when a species’ range is split into two or more isolated subdivisions (i.e. “vicariance”). **But vicariance alone is ultimately limited in its ability to generate diversity**, as ranges can only be split so many times and still support viable populations. For diversification to continue, lineages must expand geographically to attain range sizes that can bear further subdivision. In nature, this means lineages must often overlap with close relatives. 

Speciation and the establishment of sympatry are thus the two critical rate-limiting steps in the diversification cycle. The primary focus of my research to-date has been to better understand their drivers.

## Questions

### The role of ecological divergence in speciation and the establishment of sympatry

For the past twenty years, evolutionary ecologists have largely viewed diversification through the lens of the Ecological Theory of Adaptive Radiation (ETAR; Schluter 2000), an intuitive and influential synthesis in which both speciation and the establishment of sympatry are driven by divergent natural selection. In the theory's classic formulation, reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of behavioural, phenotypic, or intrinsic genetic changes that accumulate when allopatric lineages adapt in different directions along niche axes such as habitat or diet (“ecological speciation”). Later, when lineages begin to overlap geographically, competition for resources leads to renewed divergent selection and greater ecological divergence (“ecological character displacement”).

Evidence for the ETAR's main tenets has been reported in a number of detailed studies, leading many authors to suggest that adaptive radiation is a generally important mechanism in
diversification1,12. But despite its success, predictions of the ETAR have primarily been supported in systems from young island-like habitats5-7,13, while they have remained largely untested in continental environments where the vast majority of species occur. Newly discovered patterns of morphological and genetic diversity in continental taxa, meanwhile, contradict some expectations of this framework14-21. In particular, genomic evidence from tropical avian contact zones show that reproductive isolation readily evolves to virtual completion between lineages with marked ecological similarity. And a growing number of macroevolutionary analyses conclude that clade-wide diversification is more limited by geographic than ecological opportunity. These data call into question whether diversification dynamics observed on island can in fact scale up to explain continental diversity. 

An outstanding question is whether evolutionary ecology's leading model of diversification applies in the more complex ecological theatres in which diversity most generally evolves.

### The role of sexual interference in preventing the establishment of sympatry

Ecological competition has long been considered an important factor determining how and if species can coexist, but an often-overloooked factor is that of sexual interference between closely related lineages. Sexual interference is costly 


### Geographic variation in the processes promoting speciation and coexistence

Species richness is unevenly distributed across the globe. geographical variation in extinction is almost certainly a very significant driver these patterns. Geographic variation in diversification processes may also contribute. 




Addressing the generality of ecological divergence as an engine of diversification requires a statistical comparative approach. While fine-grained ecological details can't feasibly be obtained for very large numbers of lineages, ecological *differences* between closely related species can be inferred from differences in ecomorphology. Such ecological trait measurements are much more readiliy obtainable from field and museum specimens.

**Scale**: Many models of ecomorphological evolution are concerned with changes in traits across the branches of a phylogenetic tree over relatively deep time. But the processes affecting speciation and coexistence a focus on trait divergence between closely related (and thus recently diverged) lineages means contemporary macroevolution. 

I thus work with and formulate models of trait divergence between closely related lineage pairs including sister species and 'phylogroup' splits within currently recognized taxonomic species. These models cover timescales relevant to most speciation events, which typically require hundreds to single-digit thousands of millenia (exceptional examples of rapid (and often-ephemeral) speciation on islands notwithstanding).

Model processes: divergent adaptation. Sister species (or deeply diverged 'phylogroups' within currently recognized taxonomic species). 

#### Speciation

#### Stable Coexistence (i.e. sympatry)






The main tenets of the ETAR have been
For much of the recent past, evolutionary ecologists working on speciation and coexistence have relied on naturally occurring model systems -- recently diverged lineages evolving in simplified ecological settings such as young habitat islands. While these systems are tractable, their environmental circustances are exceptional. This makes generalizataion difficult. My work often centres around lineages evolving in the more complex continental settings home to most of life.
